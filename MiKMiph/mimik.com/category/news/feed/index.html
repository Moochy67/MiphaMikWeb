<p>By tapping mimik’s hybrid edge cloud platform, Business &amp; Decision will harness the full potential of enabling technologies such as 5G to advance the widespread use of AI and IoT across industries</p>



<p><b>Oakland, CA and Paris, France, May 11, 2022:</b> <a href="https://mimik.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mimik Technology Inc</a>., a pioneer in hybrid edge cloud technology, and <a href="https://www.businessdecision.com/be-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Business &amp; Decision</a>, a leading consultancy and system integrator and part of the Orange Group specializing in data intelligence and digital experiences, have partnered to advance the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Business &amp; Decision will incorporate mimik’s technology to deliver solutions that will reduce latency and lower bandwidth consumption while improving data security for global clients in industries such as retail, transportation, finance, and the public sector. These architectural improvements enable mimik and Business &amp; Decision to harness the full potential of the 5G network speeds required to accelerate digital transformation.</p>



<p>“Although 5G promises low latency, the reality is that application speed and performance are highly dependent on the underlying architecture,” says Carlo Schots, Sales Director, Business &amp; Decision. “As a result, any advantages we’ve seen in network speed disappear on the backend—until now. The mimik platform enables us to bypass traditional, centralized cloud solutions and process development workloads in a high-performance edge environment that enables real-time connectivity at 5G speeds. We are excited to partner with mimik to bring these important capabilities to our enterprise clients, enabling their low-risk and seamless digital transformation journeys in a highly secure data environment.”</p>



<p>mimik is reimagining the cloud, enabling any smart device—whether it’s a smartphone, smart IoT device, or AI-based sensor—to act as a cloud server. By leveraging mimik’s technology, Business &amp; Decision clients will benefit from lower total cost of ownership because most workloads are offloaded to these devices and processed at the edge versus in the cloud. This in turn reduces their overall data center footprint and associated costs, and cuts carbon emissions. Clients also maintain full control of their data, ensuring their customers’ privacy while strengthening data governance in a hyper-connected world.</p>



<p>“Business &amp; Decision has the proven expertise and experience in systems integration and data-driven technologies that further innovation and accelerate digital transformation,” says Sam Armani, SVP Business Development, mimik Technology. “We look forward to our partnership to help Business &amp; Decision’s customers accelerate their digital transformation and attain unprecedented efficiencies and performance improvements enabled by mimik’s hybrid edge cloud platform and edge-based microservices.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>mimik Contributes edgeEngine Integration as Open-Source Code to LF Edge’s Open Horizon Project, Added as Partner and Member of the Technical Steering Committee</p>
<p><b>Oakland, CA, March 30, 2022</b> – mimik Technology today announced that mimik has completed an edgeEngine integration with the Linux Foundation’s <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/openhorizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Horizon</a> project and contributed the code to <a href="http://www.lfedge.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LF Edge</a>. This first-of-its-kind intelligent workflow management and DevOps tool manages containerized workloads from the central cloud all the way to endpoints on heterogeneous edge devices. The integration creates an array of opportunities in use cases such as factory automation, retail management, fintech, healthcare, telecommunications and automotive, where commodity endpoint devices can now become part of a fully integrated and simply managed software delivery solution. In recognition of their significant contribution to Open Horizon, mimik has been invited to join the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) as a voting member and as a partner of the project alongside IBM, providing valuable input on the technical strategy for the platform as it delivers AI-driven distributed workflow management solutions.</p>
<p>“mimik is delighted to contribute to Open Horizon and we are honored to join the steering committee and serve as partner for this important initiative,” said Michel Burger, chief technology officer of mimik. “We are excited by the opportunities created by the integration of mimik’s platform with the IBM Edge Application Manager and are actively engaged in a number of deployments and proofs of concept that demonstrate the power of the combined solution.”</p>
<p>The addition of mimik’s edgeEngine software as a deployable target to Open Horizon enables IBM Edge Application Manager – a downstream, commercially-supported product based on Open Horizon – to extend its workload management capabilities beyond Linux gateways all the way down to smart devices such as smartphones and sensors. This extension allows solution providers to manage these commodity heterogenous computing devices in a wide range of applications, for instance, where they can be used as robot-assisted inspection cameras or point of sale terminals. The mimik edgeEngine software, running on these smart devices, provides the essential bridge to the Open Horizon solution.</p>
<p>“The Open Horizon project is glad to accept mimik’s contribution and is eager to collaborate with them as our first new project partner since being founded by IBM,” said Joe Pearson, chair of the Open Horizon project at LF Edge. “The integration of Open Horizon’s application deployment and lifecycle management solution with mimik Technology’s edgeEngine helps us to fulfill the fundamental promise of edge computing: to manage applications and machine learning securely and efficiently across large fleets of heterogeneous devices regardless of their connected state. I can’t wait to see how this cooperation will begin to transform communications, retail, automotive, and agriculture in the very near future.”</p>
<p>mimik’s significant contribution to the Open Horizon project has led to its appointment to the project’s Technical Steering Committee, a group that sets the development roadmap, manages governance rules, and sets code management policies for the project. mimik is the first contributing software company to join the committee and as a partner of the project, underscoring its commitment to the initiative and willingness to open-source its code to further industry development and adoption of edge software solutions. <a href="https://www.lfedge.org/projects/openhorizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Horizon</a> is an open-source software project within the LF Edge umbrella group and serves as a cornerstone project within the organization. As a platform for managing the service software lifecycle of containerized workloads and machine learning assets, it supports autonomous application management to edge computing nodes and devices at massive scale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s business environment, particularly in the tech industry, it’s all too easy to get caught up in the warp-speed pace of day-to-day activity. When we’re all flat out developing products, building partnerships, winning customers, securing funding, we can sometimes forget to celebrate what really fuels our success: our culture.</p>
<p>At mimik, we are very proud of our culture—it is what makes us unique in a sea of sameness. It makes us human in what can be an impersonal business.</p>
<p>mimik values and promotes diversity and inclusivity. We rely on science, facts, and actualities, and reject dogma, disinformation, and politicization. We are passionate supporters of freedom and equality for all of humanity. We embrace kindness and compassion in all that we do. We are committed to creating a sustainable and equitable digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>We celebrate our culture—these values that give us purpose—every single day.</p>
<p>But we wanted to do more—we wanted to also honor our mimik family, to recognize their many contributions and achievements that make mimik the amazing place it is today. So, we created mimik day, a company holiday that will be held every year, on the third Friday in March.</p>
<p>The inspiration for mimik day comes from two extraordinary women whose commitment, sacrifices, and love have been so important to mimik’s growth and success.</p>
<p><b>Sam Armani</b>, our senior vice president of business development, has been here from the beginning. She has worn many hats at mimik, including acting CEO, always working selflessly to do whatever is best for the company, putting the mimik family before her own interests.</p>
<p><b>Cecilia Lai</b>, our director of finance, joined mimik in 2015. She, too, has many unofficial roles at the company and her nurturing and caring nature has made her the “mom” of the entire mimik family. We dedicate mimik day to Sam and Cecilia.</p>
<p>We welcome everyone to join us in mimik day—take the time to celebrate your culture, your people.</p>
