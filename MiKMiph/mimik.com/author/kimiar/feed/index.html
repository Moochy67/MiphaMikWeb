<p>Abstract</p>



<p>As we transition from the mobile internet to the &#8216;Cognitive Internet,&#8217; a significant shift occurs in how we engage with technology and intelligence. We contend that the Cognitive Internet goes beyond the Cognitive Internet of Things (Cognitive IoT), enabling connected objects to independently acquire knowledge and understanding. Unlike the Mobile Internet and Cognitive IoT, the Cognitive Internet integrates collaborative intelligence throughout the network, blending the cognitive IoT realm with system-wide collaboration and human intelligence. This integrated intelligence facilitates interactions between devices, services, entities, and individuals across diverse domains while preserving decision-making autonomy and accommodating various identities.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The paper delves into the foundational elements, distinct characteristics, benefits, and industrial impact of the &#8216;Cognitive Internet&#8217; paradigm. It highlights the importance of adaptable AI infrastructures and hybrid edge cloud (HEC) platforms in enabling this shift. This evolution brings forth cognitive services, a Knowledge as a Service (KaaS) economy, enhanced decision-making autonomy, sustainable digital progress, advancements in data management, processing techniques, and a stronger emphasis on privacy.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In essence, this paper serves as a crucial resource for understanding and leveraging the transformative potential of HEC for Cognitive Internet. Supported by case studies, forward-looking perspectives, and real-world applications, it provides comprehensive insights into this emerging paradigm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TORONTO — As provinces begin to reopen their economies,&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;movement afoot&nbsp;to use mobile phones to alert&nbsp;health authorities to&nbsp;new cases that could lead to future outbreaks.</p>



<p>Health authorities say that containment of the pandemic will depend on&nbsp;quick identification and monitoring of&nbsp;people&nbsp;who have been in&nbsp;close contact with someone infected with the coronavirus, a process known as contact tracing.</p>



<p>The conventional approach to contact tracing involves labour-intensive&nbsp;in-person consultations in a medical setting, door-to-door canvassing&nbsp;or phone calls to people who are known to the patient.</p>



<p>Given that most of the population carries a cellphone or smartphone with them, there’s a push from&nbsp;health advocates and technology companies alike&nbsp;to add mobile apps to the list of tools used to collect and share information quickly.</p>



<p>“The idea around using mobile phones during the pandemic is based on the fact that they’re so ubiquitous,” says Emily Seto, a researcher at University of Toronto, though she noted it’s seen as a supplement rather than a replacement for manual tracing.</p>



<p>Cell phones with contact tracing software installed use the phone’s&nbsp;Bluetooth capabilities&nbsp;to&nbsp;log every other&nbsp;app-equipped mobile device it comes close to,&nbsp;providing a detailed record for health officials to follow in the event of an exposure to a virus carrier.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&nbsp;said last month that federal&nbsp;public health&nbsp;authorities and&nbsp;their provincial counterparts are investigating whether&nbsp;they should recommend a particular mobile phone app.</p>



<p>However, it’s unclear if Canadians will agree to divulge sensitive&nbsp;information about themselves through their phone, said Seto,&nbsp;a University of Toronto&nbsp;assistant professor who researches&nbsp;health informatics.</p>



<p>“It’s a balance between ethics, in terms of privacy and confidentiality, and what is good for the public,” Seto says.</p>



<p>While Singapore, Australia and other countries were early to adopt mobile phones to locate or notify people with COVID-19, Canada and the United States are being cautious because of concerns raised about&nbsp;privacy and security.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;Canada, Alberta&nbsp;launched&nbsp;ABTraceTogether, an app&nbsp;that’s in use in the province.&nbsp;According to the province’s website, the app creates a&nbsp;unique user number for each device it’s installed on and shares only that number in the event it becomes relevant in an exposure case. No other user data, such as phone numbers or names, are revealed.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Vancouver-based company with expertise in data security says it has developed a new app that does away with the need for&nbsp;users to trust their private information to a central server.</p>



<p>“I believe the main issue is data privacy,” says Fay Arjomandi, founder and chief executive of Mimik Technology Inc., which has developed a contract tracing application called Pandimik.</p>



<p>“With our solution, we’re basically saying that your user information is not going to get stored in a centralized place and you can decide whether to inform a health authority when you choose to.”</p>



<p>She says&nbsp;Pandimik turns a user’s phone into a virtual server that can send notifications directly to other devices without a health authority’s intervention.</p>



<p>Seto, from the University of Toronto, says one weakness of using mobile phones against the COVID pandemic is that it depends on somebody first&nbsp;getting a positive test result and then sharing it for the general good.</p>



<p>Telus Corp. says it is working&nbsp;on a different approach&nbsp;that uses&nbsp;carefully anonymized&nbsp;data from its mobile phone network&nbsp;to monitor travel patterns of groups rather than individuals.</p>



<p>Pam Snively, chief data and trust officer at Telus, says the information can help predict where&nbsp;large numbers of people&nbsp;likely to travel, so policy makers can adjust their public health strategies if COVID is detected in a particular area.</p>



<p>“We think we can provide a tremendous amount of insight and help with better decision-making with that data alone. And we know that’s truly privacy protective,” Snively says.</p>



<p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published&nbsp;June 1, 2020.</p>
