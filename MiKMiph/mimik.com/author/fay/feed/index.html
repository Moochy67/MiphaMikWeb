										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="669e">Once upon a time, there lived a young and curious infant named Alex. Alex was a bright and adventurous boy, always eager to explore and learn from the world around him. As he grew older, his physical abilities and understanding of the world deepened.</p>



<p id="27ad">In his early years, Alex relied on simple means to fulfill his needs. When hungry, he would cry out for attention, signaling his desire for nourishment. Like any caring parents, his mom and dad would respond by preparing a meal for him. But as Alex continued to learn and develop, something extraordinary happened — he started to become more and more autonomous.</p>



<p id="8f99">No longer needing to cry for every meal, Alex’s mind evolved into a complex system of interconnected thoughts and capabilities. With a simple thought, he could decide whether to cook a meal at home using his own skills or venture out to discover the diverse culinary offerings of the city. He had become a self-sufficient entity, relying on his own intelligence and resources to navigate the world.</p>



<p id="658e">In this captivating analogy, Alex’s journey from infancy to autonomy mirrors the evolution our digital world needs. Today, internet applications are like Alex in his infancy, reliant on external resources and centralized cloud architecture for even the most basic tasks. However, for true autonomy to flourish, a transformation is required — a transition from dependence on centralized infrastructure to leveraging the local resources of the devices they run on, just like Alex relies on his brain and body parts as an adult.</p>



<p id="eb55">Hybrid edge cloud (HEC) empowers these internet applications to tap into the local resources of the devices they reside on, like how Alex relies on his brain and body parts to function. It is a paradigm shift that unlocks the true power within, enabling applications to operate autonomously, adapt to their surroundings, and harness the potential of their host devices. Much like Alex’s transformation into a self-sufficient being, this transition from infancy to adulthood allows internet applications to mature and become capable of independent decision-making, reducing reliance on external resources.</p>



<p id="2325">By embracing this new era of technological innovation, we pave the way for an AI-enabled world where intelligent things can operate independently and make intelligent decisions. HEC acts as the missing link that harnesses the power of local computing resources available on each device. It reduces latency, improves performance, and enables real-time decision-making. Much like Alex’s journey towards autonomy, HEC fosters an environment where internet applications can mature and grow, mirroring the growth of Alex into an autonomous being.</p>



<p id="168a">As we embark on this journey, the power within acts as a catalyst, empowering each internet application to unleash its true potential. By leveraging the local resources of the devices they run on, we can usher in a future where applications operate autonomously, tap into their own intelligence, and redefine the boundaries of what is possible.</p>



<p id="f482">So let us embark on this remarkable adventure, where the possibilities are endless, and the potential for innovation knows no bounds. By embracing the power within, internet applications can transcend their infancy and become autonomous, mature entities that choreograph their own destinies.</p><p>The post <a href="https://mimik.com/the-journey-to-autonomy-unleashing-the-power-within/">The Journey to Autonomy: Unleashing the Power Within</a> first appeared on <a href="https://mimik.com">mimik Technology Inc</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today’s business environment, particularly in the tech industry, it’s all too easy to get caught up in the warp-speed pace of day-to-day activity. When we’re all flat out developing products, building partnerships, winning customers, securing funding, we can sometimes forget to celebrate what really fuels our success: our culture.</p>
<p>At mimik, we are very proud of our culture—it is what makes us unique in a sea of sameness. It makes us human in what can be an impersonal business.</p>
<p>mimik values and promotes diversity and inclusivity. We rely on science, facts, and actualities, and reject dogma, disinformation, and politicization. We are passionate supporters of freedom and equality for all of humanity. We embrace kindness and compassion in all that we do. We are committed to creating a sustainable and equitable digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>We celebrate our culture—these values that give us purpose—every single day.</p>
<p>But we wanted to do more—we wanted to also honor our mimik family, to recognize their many contributions and achievements that make mimik the amazing place it is today. So, we created mimik day, a company holiday that will be held every year, on the third Friday in March.</p>
<p>The inspiration for mimik day comes from two extraordinary women whose commitment, sacrifices, and love have been so important to mimik’s growth and success.</p>
<p><b>Sam Armani</b>, our senior vice president of business development, has been here from the beginning. She has worn many hats at mimik, including acting CEO, always working selflessly to do whatever is best for the company, putting the mimik family before her own interests.</p>
<p><b>Cecilia Lai</b>, our director of finance, joined mimik in 2015. She, too, has many unofficial roles at the company and her nurturing and caring nature has made her the “mom” of the entire mimik family. We dedicate mimik day to Sam and Cecilia.</p>
<p>We welcome everyone to join us in mimik day—take the time to celebrate your culture, your people.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s hyperconnected world is a result of several trends maturing and intersecting over the past decade, effectively decentralizing communications, computing, cloud, and business processes.</p>



<p>The widespread availability of smartphones and other devices with significant computational capability has resulted in the decentralisation of computing. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are advancing to the point that they are pushing digital transformation and automation across all industries, which will necessitate more processing power than the central cloud can provide.</p>



<p>The idea of deploying a new decentralised edge cloud has also grown more important.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First generation cloud technology has given users access to storage, files, softwares, and more through devices connected to the Internet, instead of over a hard drive. this same type of cloud technology initially worked through the hosting of siloed apps, where users went to the web to access the information they needed and by doing so got serviced through a central cloud.</p>



<p>the future however is looking brighter as it’s all about a hyperconnected web where apps and devices connect and communicate through a combination of edge devices and servers in the central cloud. at mimik, we believe that the future is about decentralizing the cloud by enabling all computing devices to act as servers to protect our data, minimize usage of energy and other resources to help save our planet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Enter hybrid edgeCloud computing</h2>



<p>like with any technology that is rapidly evolving, cloud technology has also evolved in the face of a more hyper-connected world. changes with future innovations have allowed for an interconnected web where different apps and devices communicate using both edge devices and servers in the central cloud. these ‘edge’ devices can be anything from smartphones, tablets, PCs, smart TVs, game consoles, robots, drones, and AI-based sensors.</p>



<p>an edgeCloud platform allows any computing device to act as a server, letting other devices communicate directly to the application layer, hence developing a hybrid edgeCloud that is larger, faster, cheaper, and with stronger data privacy for its users.</p>



<p>mimik’s disruptive technology essentially is for cloud decentralization &#8212; as each edge device gets to act as a server. mimik’s hybrid edgeCloud does not need any hubs or gateways and can leverage the processing power, storage, and memory of all computing devices. the good part about the hybrid edgeCloud is that it runs on any platform be it windows, android, mac os, iOS, linux, or raspbian.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Benefits of edgeCloud technology</h2>



<ul>
<li>optimal privacy — you can process sensitive data on local edge devices, eliminating the unnecessary middlemen.</li>



<li>lowest costs — reduce hosting and bandwidth costs by maximizing the use of resources on edge devices.</li>



<li>lowest latencies — using the shortest-path communications between devices, microservices, and clusters at the edge.</li>



<li>rapid app development — developers can utilize the familiar api development framework, languages, and compatibility with container and orchestration tools for native application development.</li>



<li>lowest carbon footprint — cut data transfer by upto 70% and improve system-level efficiency.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>what does this mean for developers?  </b>developers can take advantage of the benefits in efficiency and processing power, in helping them accelerate their product development while using mimik’s platform. the platform comes with a run-time engine that enables developers to work with global functions in the central cloud while moving processing workloads to different edge devices such as smartphones or TVs. <b> </b>developers can experience its flexibility as the engine is agnostic to any OS, device, network, or cloud — being non-proprietary, it can work with the already existing standard development tools. mimik also offers ready-to-deploy edge microservices for a wide range of industry verticals. mimik’s platform is free to develop and has a pay-as-you-grow pricing plan, letting you easily scale up. <b> learn more about mimik’s hybrid edgeCloud </b>mimik is passionate about democratizing the cloud and Internet so that each person can equally benefit, as well as minimize energy use through efficiency to save on our planet’s already limited resources. mimik extends cloud server capability to all computing devices, consumer, and enterprise applications. we do this by making “the cloud” larger, easily scalable, and efficient to meet the needs of an increasingly hyperconnected world. this results in inter-operable apps, savings in time and hosting costs, savings in network bandwidth, reduction in latency, and improved data privacy for users.  to learn more about our technology get in touch with an edgeExpert today : <a href="/contact-us/">Contact Us</a>.<br></p><p>The post <a href="https://mimik.com/what-is-hybrid-edgecloud-and-why-will-it-change-the-way-we-develop-apps/">what is hybrid edgeCloud and why will it change the way we develop apps?</a> first appeared on <a href="https://mimik.com">mimik Technology Inc</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
